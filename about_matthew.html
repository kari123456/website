            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            Hi! My name is Matthew Daw. I am an undergraduate student 
                at <a href="http://math.byu.edu/">Brigham Young University</a>
                studying <a href="https://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/">Applied Math</a> 
                with an emphasis in data science and machine learning. I grew up in Orem Utah and am intending to 
                begin my masters in computer science September 2022 at <a href="http://math.byu.edu/">Brigham Young University</a>.

            <h2>Research</h2>
                
                My research is mostly concerned with computer vision
                Currently I am researching an algorithm to track 200+ bees with real time inference speed (results coming soon). 
                I also have done a lot of work in improving object detection and tracking with transformers. This research was mostly done during my internship with Air Force Research Laboratories from April 2021 to January 2022.
        
            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

                From May 2021 to the present I have been working with a stealth start-up
                 company. I am the main data scientist there and have developed 
                 algorithms to help with sensor processing and predicting how 
                 people will use various appliances in their homes.
        
            <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>

            From June 2019 to June 2021 I served as a full time missionary for 
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/">The Church of 
                Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>  in Ghana Accra. 
                While I was there, I found that few things make me happier than
                helping create oportunities for people who most need it. After returning, I have
                 reached out to help several people who I considered very decent honest people
                who deserved better. Currently, I am supporting three families and helping several 
                individuals learn free lance web developement (most of this web page was actuall created by one them). One of them recently 
                started getting paid work and will be earning roughly 400% more than the average working person,
                that amount is expected to go up quickly as he develops his portfolio. Long term I hope to build a school to provide oportunities like this to many more individuals.
        
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        
            I enjoy practicing memorizing decks of cards (P.R. is 5m 20s), practicing mindfulness, and working through my relatively large collection of board games with friends and family.
             I also love to study history, particularly World War II (I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich">this</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93959.Hirohito_and_the_Making_of_Modern_Japan?ref=nav_sb_noss_l_9">this</a> book), and I am low key obsessed 
             with everything The Lord of The Rings (including the Hobbit, as long as it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB6h9uCAZmI">this cut</a> ).
